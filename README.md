# bookshelf-softdelete
This plugin works with Bookshelf.js, available here http://bookshelfjs.org, in order to introduce a soft deletion. What this means is that items will appear deleted to an end user, but will not in fact be removed from the database.

This is based on https://github.com/lanetix/node-bookshelf-soft-delete.git
